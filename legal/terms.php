            <h3 id="filing-claims-under-dmca">Filing claims under DMCA</h3> <p>Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), you can 
            request that the Owner remove material that infringes a copyright. To do so you must file a document that is known as a 
            DMCA “takedown notice”, which must comply with the requirements specified by the law.</p> <p>In particular, your “takedown notice” 
            must include:</p> <ul> <li style="list-style-type: disc;">a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive 
            right that is allegedly infringed;</li> <li style="list-style-type: disc;">identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple 
            copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;</li> 
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is 
            to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to 
            locate the material;</li> <li style="list-style-type: disc;">information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party,
            such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be 
            contacted;</li> <li style="list-style-type: disc;">a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner 
            complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</li> <li style="list-style-type: disc;">a statement that the information in 
            the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the 
            owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li> </ul> <p>If you knowingly misrepresent in your 
            notification that the material or activity is infringing, you will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' 
            fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer as the result of our relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling 
            access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing.</p> <h3 id="changes-to-these-terms">Changes to these Terms</h3> 
            <p>The Owner reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time, informing Users by publishing a notice within Acme Stickers.</p>

            will remain in force.</p> <h3 id="governing-law-and-jurisdiction">Governing law and jurisdiction</h3> <p>These Terms and any
