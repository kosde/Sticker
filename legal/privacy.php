            without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the 
            processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li> <li style="list-style-type: disc;">provision of Data is necessary for the 
            performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li> <li style="list-style-type: disc;">processing is

            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li> 
            </ul> <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and

            to enter into a contract. </p> <h3>Place</h3> <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other 
            places where the parties involved in the processing are located.<br><br> Depending on the User's location, data transfers

            this section we summarize the categories of personal information that we've collected, disclosed or sold and the purposes thereof. 
            <strong>You can read about these activities in detail in the section titled “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” 
            within this document.</strong></p> <h4>Information we collect: the categories of personal information we collect</h4> <p>We have 
            collected the following categories of personal information about you: identifiers and internet information.</p> <p>We will not 
            collect additional categories of personal information without notifying you.</p> <h4>How we collect information: what are the 
            sources of the personal information we collect?</h4> <p>We collect the above mentioned categories of personal information, either 
            directly or indirectly, from you when you use Acme Stickers.</p> <p>For example, you directly provide your personal information when 
            you submit requests via any forms on Acme Stickers. You also provide personal information indirectly when you navigate Acme Stickers, 
            as personal information about you is automatically observed and collected. Finally, we may collect your personal information from 
            third parties that work with us in connection with the Service or with the functioning of Acme Stickers and features thereof.</p> 
            <h4>How we use the information we collect: sharing and disclosing of your personal information with third parties for a business 
            purpose</h4> <p>We may disclose the personal information we collect about you to a third party for business purposes. In this 
            case, we enter a written agreement with such third party that requires the recipient to both keep the personal information 
            confidential and not use it for any purpose(s) other than those necessary for the performance of the agreement.</p> 
            <p>We may also disclose your personal information to third parties when you explicitly ask or authorize us to do so, in order 
            to provide you with our Service.</p> <p>To find out more about the purposes of processing, please refer to the relevant section 
            of this document.</p> <h4>Sale of your personal information</h4> <p>For our purposes, the word “sale” means any “selling, 
            renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by 
            electronic means, a consumer's personal information by the business to <strong>another business or a third party, for monetary or 
            other valuable consideration</strong>”.</p> <p>This means that, for example, a sale can happen whenever an application runs ads, or 
            makes statistical analyses on the traffic or views, or simply because it uses tools such as social network plugins and the like.</p>

            <strong>Acme Stickers does not share any text messaging originator opt-in data and consent with any third parties.</strong>
            <h4>Your right to opt out of the sale of personal information</h4> <p>You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal 
            information. This means that whenever you request us to stop selling your data, we will abide by your request.<br>Such requests 
            can be made freely, at any time, without submitting any verifiable request, simply by following the instructions below.</p> 
            <h4>Instructions to opt out of the sale of personal information</h4> <p>If you’d like to know more, or exercise your right to 
            opt out in regard to all the sales carried out by Acme Stickers, both online and offline, you can contact us for further information 
            using the contact details provided in this document.</p> <h4>What are the purposes for which we use your personal information?</h4>

            In such cases, your personal information will be processed in a fashion necessary and proportionate to the business purpose for which 
            it was collected, and strictly within the limits of compatible operational purposes.</p> <p>We may also use your personal information 
            for other reasons such as for commercial purposes (as indicated within the section “Detailed information on the processing of 
            Personal Data” within this document), as well as for complying with the law and defending our rights before the competent 
            authorities where our rights and interests are threatened or we suffer an actual damage.</p> <p>We will not use your personal 
            information for different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without notifying you.</p> <h3>Your California privacy rights and 
            how to exercise them</h3> <h4>The right to know and to portability</h4> <p>You have the right to request that we disclose to 
            you:</p> <ul> <li style="list-style-type: disc;">the categories and sources of the personal information that we collect about you, the purposes for which we use your 
            information and with whom such information is shared;</li> <li style="list-style-type: disc;"> in case of sale of personal information or disclosure for a business 
            purpose, two separate lists where we disclose: <ul> <li style="list-style-type: disc;">for sales, the personal information categories purchased by each category 
            of recipient; and </li> <li style="list-style-type: disc;">for disclosures for a business purpose, the personal information categories obtained by each category 
            of recipient.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or 
            used over the past 12 months.</p> <p>If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be "portable", i.e. 
            delivered in an easily usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance – provided that 
            this is technically feasible.</p> <h4>The right to request the deletion of your personal information</h4> <p>You have the right to 
            request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not 
            limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on Acme Stickers, to detect security incidents and protect 
            against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).</p> <p>If no legal exception applies, as a result of 
            exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and direct any of our service providers to do so.</p> <h4>How to 
            exercise your rights</h4> <p>To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting 
            us via the details provided in this document.</p> <p>For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. 
            Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:</p> <ul> <li style="list-style-type: disc;">provide sufficient 
            information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized 
            representative;</li> <li style="list-style-type: disc;">describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond 
            to it.</li> </ul> <p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal 
            information in our possession actually relates to you.</p> <p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize 
            a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p> <p>If you are an adult, you can make a
